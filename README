I created this project, because I think the original Dropbox SDK wasn't really created the Android way. I divided it into two Eclips projects:

DropboxSDK: The Android Library Project, which contains the helper classes and all Java libraries needed.

DropboxSample: A sample Eclipse project which shows how to use the SDK.

To use the SDK in your own project, you need to take these steps:
1. Pull the repository
2. File > Import... > Existing Projects into Workspace > Select the DropboxSDK folder
3. Add the SDK as a library to your own project
4. Add the SDK's .jar files to your project's build path
5. Make sure that your app has permission to access the internet!

The original SDK can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/releases
